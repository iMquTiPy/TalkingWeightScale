-> Talking weighing scale for visually impaired students with a button to detect the data present on the weighing scale.
-> Hardware used in Talking Color Sensor : Raspberry pi 3 with a camera module , a component speaker and raspi Hat.
-> Each digit on the weighing scale is represented by a  seven-segment component. Seven-segment displays can take on a total of 128 possible states.
-> However we need to recognise only 10 values - the digit zero to nine 
-> First, we have to detect screen display from the original image.
-> Apply Contour detection method to detect only screen display.
-> Apply  basic  threshold and morphological operation on the display screen. 
-> Again apply contour detection code to Identify the digits
-> We start looping over each of the digit contours and extract each individual digit by comparing all the seven segments and detect which one is on/off.
-> We now have the digits extracted from the image.
